# Intuition
To generate all possible subsets of an array that may contain duplicates, we need to ensure that no duplicate subsets are included in the result. The first thought is to use a backtracking approach to explore all possible subsets while skipping over duplicates.

# Approach
1. **Sorting**: Start by sorting the array. This helps in easily identifying and skipping duplicates.
2. **Backtracking**: Use a backtracking function to generate subsets. The function takes the starting index and the current subset (path).
3. **Avoiding Duplicates**: During the backtracking process, skip over duplicate elements by checking if the current element is the same as the previous one.
4. **Recursive Exploration**: Recursively explore all subsets by including or excluding the current element.
5. **Result Collection**: Collect all unique subsets in the result list.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: 
  The time complexity is $$O(2^n)$$ because in the worst case, we generate all possible subsets of the array, where `n` is the length of the array.

- **Space complexity**: 
  The space complexity is also $$O(2^n)$$ because we store all the subsets in the result list. Additionally, the recursion stack can go up to a depth of `n`.

# Code
```python
class Solution:
    def subsetsWithDup(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:

        def backtrack(start, path):
            res.append(path)
            for i in range(start, len(nums)):
                if i > start and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                    continue
                backtrack(i + 1, path + [nums[i]])

        nums.sort()
        res = []
        backtrack(0, [])
        return res
